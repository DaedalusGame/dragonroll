dragonroll
==========
A D&D re-imagining of Space Station 13.

dragonroll is a re-creation of the popular internet game, Space Station 13, with semi-D&D style gameplay.
It is set in an alternate, steampunk-like future version of Space Station 13, meaning it follows a retrofuturism/steampunk look for 
object and art style (as well as most items and other things).

Similar to Space Station 13, it is based on the BYOND engine.

Installing
==========
If you would like to download and try dragonroll, you can download the source by using the "Download Zip" button,
or using your git program of choice to clone the master repository.

To play or host the game, [you need BYOND](www.byond.com).

To start, open the dragonroll.dme file with DreamMaker (included with byond), and hit the "Build > Compile" button
(or CTRL-K).

If it outputs the following message:

>*saving dragonroll.dmb (DEBUG mode)*
>*dragonroll.dmb - 0 errors, 0 warnings*

You have succesfully compiled the game.

Run DreamDaemon (also included with byond), and select the compiled dragonroll.dmb file,
and press the green "GO" button.

When it finishes starting (and reports the port can be reached), click the yellow Arrow to join.
